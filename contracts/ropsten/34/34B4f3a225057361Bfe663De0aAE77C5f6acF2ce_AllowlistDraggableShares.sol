/**
 * @title Draggable CompanyName AG Shares
 * @author Luzius Meisser, [emailÂ protected]
 *
 * This is an ERC-20 token representing shares of CompanyName AG that are bound to
 * a shareholder agreement that can be found at the URL defined in the constant 'terms'.
 * The shareholder agreement is partially enforced through this smart contract. The agreement
 * is designed to facilitate a complete acquisition of the firm even if a minority of shareholders
 * disagree with the acquisition, to protect the interest of the minority shareholders by requiring
 * the acquirer to offer the same conditions to everyone when acquiring the company, and to
 * facilitate an update of the shareholder agreement even if a minority of the shareholders that
 * are bound to this agreement disagree. The name "draggable" stems from the convention of calling
 * the right to drag a minority along with a sale of the company "drag-along" rights. The name is
 * chosen to ensure that token holders are aware that they are bound to such an agreement.
 *
 * The percentage of token holders that must agree with an update of the terms is defined by the
 * constant UPDATE_QUORUM. The percentage of yes-votes that is needed to successfully complete an
 * acquisition is defined in the constant ACQUISITION_QUORUM. Note that the update quorum is based
 * on the total number of tokens in circulation. In contrast, the acquisition quorum is based on the
 * number of votes cast during the voting period, not taking into account those who did not bother
 * to vote.
