/*
  An ERC20 token contract keeps track of fungible tokens: any one token is exactly equal to any 
  other token; no tokens have special rights or behavior associated with them. 
  This makes ERC20 tokens useful for things like a medium of exchange currency, voting rights, staking, and more.

  Fungible goods are equivalent and interchangeable, like Ether, fiat currencies, and voting rights.
  Non-fungible goods are unique and distinct, like deeds of ownership, or collectibles.

  when dealing with non-fungibles (like your house) you care about which ones you have, while in fungible assets 
  (like your bank account statement) what matters is how much you have.
