/**
 * @notice A market for a perpetual contract, a financial derivative which may be traded on margin
 *  and which aims to closely track the spot price of an underlying asset. The underlying asset is
 *  specified via the price oracle which reports its spot price. Tethering of the perpetual market
 *  price is supported by a funding oracle which governs funding payments between longs and shorts.
 * @dev Main perpetual market implementation contract that inherits from other contracts.
